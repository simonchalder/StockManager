Currently the application features:
 - Create an order and add items to the order whilst browsing by category
 - See the order so far and running total
 - Finalise the order with a simulated payment which then removes the order items from stock
 - The ability to lookup database items according to their category
 - Lookup a particular stock item using its ID number
 - Access a managers menu which in turn allows:
     - See all stock items
     - Lookup items as above
     - Add new items to stock

To-do:
 - Input validation and exception handling
 - Unit tests
 - Improve the order system with ability to choose a quantity when adding items to an order
 - Layout improvements such as tables to make data easier to read
 - Search for item by name - I can currently only do this by using the full description string
 - Speed up database queries
 - View orders for day, total sales etc.
 - Add more items to DB (currently 50)
