Currently the application features:
 - The ability to lookup database items according to their category
 - Lookup a particular stock item using its ID number
 - Access a managers menu which in turn allows:
     - See all stock items
     - Lookup items as above
     - Add new items to stock

To-do:
 - Create order system with ability to add items and close order
 - Search for item by name - I can currently only do this by using the full description string
 - View orders for day, total sales etc.
 - Add more items to DB
